## 🤝 About Me
Hello there. #insert-kenobi-meme-gif

I'm Matthew, a Data Analyst student transitioning toward a Data Engineering position, with Analytics Engineer as my long-term goal. I bring 11 years of professional experience, including 8 years in digital marketing, with strategic and operational expertise across diverse industries (tires, merchant marine, Virtual Reality accessories, and e-commerce) and targets (B2C, B2B2C, B2B, retail, army and defense forces).

This extensive background has given me a solid understanding of marketing challenges, product strategy, and ROI optimization. Currently pursuing training in Data Analysis and Data Engineering, I'm drawn to these fields for their strong business focus and natural synergy with my marketing expertise.

I'm eager to leverage my skills in data structuring, analysis, and value creation to contribute to your projects as a Data Engineer through a work-study contract (contrat de professionnalisation) starting in March 2026.

*Ô rage ! ô désespoir ! ô dataset ennemi !  
N'ai-je donc tant vécu que pour ne pas avoir ce KPI  
Et ne suis-je blanchi dans tous ces rapports clairs  
Que pour voir en un jour flétrir tant d'OKRs ?*
